# Customer-Segmentation-Revenue-Analysis

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes over 1 million e-commerce transactions to uncover revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue concentration patterns.

Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, customers were classified into behavioral segments to identify high-value groups and business revenue dependencies.


## **Business Objectives**

Analyze overall revenue performance

Identify seasonal sales trends

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior

Detect revenue concentration patterns

Evaluate geographic revenue distribution



## **Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL – Data querying and transformation

Power BI – Interactive dashboard visualization

Google Colab – Data processing environment



## **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Processed 1,067,000+ transaction records

Removed missing Customer IDs and invalid return transactions

Filtered negative quantities and zero-price entries

Created revenue column (Revenue = Quantity × Price)

Final cleaned dataset: 824,000+ valid records



## **Key KPIs**

Total Revenue: 17.74M

Total Customers: 5,878

Total Orders: 36.97K

Average Order Value (AOV): 479.95

Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Customers were segmented using:

Recency – Days since last purchase

Frequency – Number of orders

Monetary – Total spending



## **Key Findings**

Top 20% of customers generated 77% of total revenue (Pareto concentration)

Champions segment contributed 47% of total revenue

Revenue is highly dependent on high-value customer segments
